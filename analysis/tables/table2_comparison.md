## Table 2. Comparison of CoralTemp SST and in-situ logger at 5-day threshold (n=182)

| Data source | ETS | AUC | POD | FAR | Bias | H | FA | M | CN |
|-------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|------|---|----|----|-----|
| CoralTemp SST | 0.990 | 0.878 | 0.86 | 0.24 | 0.97 | 56 | 18 | 9 | 99 |
| In-situ logger | 0.791 | 0.805 | 0.77 | 0.33 | 0.87 | 50 | 25 | 15 | 92 |
| **Difference** | **+0.199** | **+0.073** | **+0.09** | **−0.09** | **+0.10** | **+6** | **−7** | **−6** | **+7** |

**Notes:** Comparison performed on the same 182 site-year observations where both satellite and logger data were available. Bleaching was observed in 65 of 182 observations (36%).
