## Table 3. Comparison with DeCarlo (2020) global analysis

| Study | Scope | Indicator | Optimal threshold | Maximum ETS |
|-------|-------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| DeCarlo (2020) | Global, 100 sites | DHW | 3.5 °C-weeks | 0.218 |
| This study | Japan, 44 sites | Days ≥30°C | 5 days | 0.84–0.99 |

**Notes:** DeCarlo (2020) optimized DHW thresholds globally using the same weather forecast verification framework. Our substantially higher ETS likely reflects regional specificity and the use of absolute temperature thresholds rather than anomaly-based metrics. Direct comparison should be interpreted with caution due to differences in temporal and spatial scale.
